I watched Theo youtube channel.

Then i'm doing a blog app with the t3 stack that contains typescript prismaORM and trpc for db queries.

Init the server on localhost along with the database on port 3000.

Run a docker container with the database on port 5432.

My cpu is overclocking due to docker container, i have an old cpu with 5 cores 2 cpu and 3 gpu not very good.

I'm still working on solutions.
